entry_point (structurally same as goal_member)
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `creator_address` must match the agent committing
- update: not allowed
- delete: allowed by anyone

goal_member (structurally same as entry_point)
- create: depends on goal at `goal_address` existing,
          `user_edit_hash` should match the agent committing
          `agent_address` is not validated because the agent is not necessarily in this DNA as a member, could be over in profiles dna
- update: not allowed
- delete: allowed by anyone
